# MIDI Controller for the Line6 HX Stomp

This is a five-button MIDI controller that sends custom CC messages to the HX Stomp.
The custom messages can be mapped on the Stomp to the functions that you want e.g. turning a block on/off.
The sketch also turns on and off five LEDs on a NeoPixel Strip.
The code was originally deployed on an Adafruit Itsybitsy 32u4.
